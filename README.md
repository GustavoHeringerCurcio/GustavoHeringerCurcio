# Hi, I'm Gustavo 👋.. <br>

### I’m a junior web developer focused on building clean, functional, and well-structured web applications.

I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently deepening my knowledge of modern frontend development using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS through hands-on projects and technical challenges.
